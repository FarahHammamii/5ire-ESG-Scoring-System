#  ESG Scoring System for Ethereum-based 5ire Blockchain

This project automates the **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scoring** for the 5ire blockchain — an Ethereum-based Layer 1 platform committed to sustainability and decentralization.

## What It Does

 Scrapes and processes structured and unstructured ESG-related data 
Integrates  DAO governance activity  
 Classifies this data into ESG categories using language models  
Performs **sentiment analysis** to score each category  
 Extracts key features from structured JSON datasets (like Gini score, governance votes, engagement)  
 Computes a **final ESG score** based on weighted category scores  
 Generates a clean and professional **PDF report**

## How the Score is Computed

The ESG score is calculated using a hybrid approach:

###  1. Classification Using LLMs
We use large language models (LLMs) to classify ESG-related text into the following categories:
- **Environmental**
- **Social**
- **Governance**

This ensures that complex and nuanced ESG data is properly categorized, even when phrased informally or embedded in long paragraphs.

###  2. Sentiment Analysis
Each sentence within these categories is scored using **TextBlob** to assess:
- Positive and negative sentiment
- Magnitude and context of each opinion

This quantifies the attitude of public and organizational discourse in ESG topics.

###  3. Feature Extraction
We extract objective, structured features directly from JSON data:
- `gini_score`: A proxy for wealth inequality
- `average_votes`: Participatory governance metric
- `average_engagement_score`: Proxy for social activity
- `Negative_Articles_Count`: Reputational risk signal
- `avg_proposal_sentiment`: Sentiment towards governance proposals

These are then combined with LLM-based classification scores to generate a final ESG score.

###  4. Final Score Formula
A weighted average is applied:
- 40% Environmental
- 30% Social
- 30% Governance
